"1","The mean number of particles not photographed during the Outside Sampling Period was 299451.7 and during the Within Sampling Period was 206271.83 . The Wilcoxon rank-sum test yielded a p-value of 0 , indicating a significant difference between the periods."
"2","17062654 particles were classified and statistics for 14848265 of these were successfully sent to the dashboard, a transmission success rate of 87.02 %"
"3","The majority of particles were classified as detritus (48.3%)  followed by copepods (33.3%) and non-copepods (18.4%), in line with expectations"
"4","Over the 7 days and 5 hours duration, 73 hours were identified as 'downtime' where the dashboard did not receive any data for over 2 minutes. This is equal to a downtime of 42%"
"5","Over the 87 bins that were compared between 2024-05-22 09:20:00 - 2024-05-22 23:50:00, the jetson edge-AI computer classified 2.3 million particles, whilst during these same ten minute time bins, post-processing classified 15 million particles. The jetson edge-AI computer classified 0.8 million particles as copepods, whilst post-processing classified 4.4 million particles as copepods."
"6","During this same time, the jetson edge-AI computer classified 1.2 million particles as detritus, whilst post-processing classified 8.5 million particles as detritus."
"7","The jetson edge-AI computer classified 0.3 million particles as non-copepod, whilst post-processing classified 2.1 million particles as non-copepod."
"8","The instrument worked continuously throughout the 7 days survey (173 hours), capturing a total of 2997309347 particles. 128349510 of these were saved to disk (hits) and shipped to cloud storage post survey. 2868959837 particles could not be imaged and saved (misses)."
"9","average particle and image rates of 300662.989968904 per min and 12874.8630755342 per min, respectively"
